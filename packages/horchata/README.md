Horchata
========

Horchata is the parser for the tacoscript language. Currently, this is simply a copy of the babylon parser, since horchata will be heavily based upon it.

## Credits

Heavily based on [babylon](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babylon), which in turn is heavily based on [acorn](https://github.com/marijnh/acorn) and [acorn-jsx](https://github.com/RReverser/acorn-jsx),
thanks to the awesome work of [@RReverser](https://github.com/RReverser) and [@marijnh](https://github.com/marijnh).

Significant derivations are expected to occur regarding parsing of significant whitespace, and formatting directives.
